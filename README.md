fire detection

Abstract:
"In this work we investigate the automatic detection of fire pixel regions in video (or still) imagery within real-time bounds without reliance on temporal scene information. As an extension to prior work in the field, we consider the performance of experimentally defined, reduced complexity deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for this task. Contrary to contemporary trends in the field, our work illustrates maximal accuracy of 0.93 for whole image binary fire detection, with 0.89 accuracy within our superpixel localization framework can be achieved, via a network architecture of significantly reduced complexity. These reduced architectures additionally offer a 3-4 fold increase in computational performance offering up to 17 fps processing on contemporary hardware independent of temporal information. We show the relative performance achieved against prior work using benchmark datasets to illustrate maximally robust real-time fire region detection."
